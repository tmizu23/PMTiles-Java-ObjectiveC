# PMTiles-Java-ObjectiveC
Implemented [PMTiles specifications](https://github.com/protomaps/PMTiles) in both Java and Objective-C, with partial code conversion from the original JavaScript and C++ implementations using ChatGPT assistance. Please note that the conversion may not be complete, and caution is advised when using the code. Only raster data has been tested, but modifications will be necessary for vector data support.
